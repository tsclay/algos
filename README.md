# Algos

A repo for classic algorithms, solutions, practice, and extensions therefrom.

## Javascript

All Javascript algos are placed in ```root/javascript```.

For JS, Jest is used to test whether proposed solutions pass the test cases. Test files are placed in ```root/javascript/<some-algo-name>/tests``` and are executed by running ```npm test```.

## Python

Create and activate venv if desired:

```bash
cd python
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Simply run ```python <path-to-algo-file>```.
